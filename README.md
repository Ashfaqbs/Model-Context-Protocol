## 2. What is MCP?

MCP defines a set of standards for how applications can supply context to LLMs. Its primary features include:

- **Standardization:** Establishing uniform guidelines to connect LLMs with multiple data sources and tools.
- **Modularity:** Facilitating the plug-and-play integration of various services, allowing seamless switching between different LLM providers.
- **Security:** Ensuring that data accessed through the protocol remains secure by incorporating best practices and secure communication channels.

By providing a common framework, MCP reduces the overhead of managing multiple custom integrations and fosters an ecosystem of interoperable components.

## 3. Why MCP?

The protocol is designed with key objectives that address prevalent challenges in AI integration:

- **Enhanced Integration:** A growing list of pre-built integrations allows LLMs to access data directly and interact with a variety of services.
- **Flexibility:** Organizations can switch between LLM vendors with minimal disruption, ensuring adaptability to evolving technology landscapes.
- **Secure Infrastructure:** MCP incorporates security measures to protect sensitive data, reinforcing our commitment to maintaining robust internal and external data channels.
- **Streamlined Workflow Development:** By standardizing interactions, MCP simplifies the development of agents and complex workflows, reducing development time and potential integration errors.

This approach not only optimizes the performance of AI applications but also establishes a reliable foundation for future innovation.

## 4. Who Benefits from MCP?

The protocol is designed for a broad range of stakeholders in the AI ecosystem:

- **Server Developers:** Those building dedicated servers can leverage MCP to create lightweight applications that expose specific capabilities. This enables efficient and secure data processing from local and remote sources.
- **Client Developers:** Teams developing client applications benefit from the 1:1 connection model with servers, ensuring reliable data retrieval and enhanced user experience.
- **End-Users and Enterprise Clients:** Applications such as desktop tools, integrated development environments (IDEs), and AI-powered utilities utilize MCP to interact with underlying data, enhancing functionality and performance.
- **Open Source Contributors:** A community-driven approach invites contributions that further refine and expand the capabilities of MCP, fostering collaborative innovation.

## 5. Architecture

MCP is built on a client-server model that establishes clear roles and responsibilities:

- **MCP Hosts:** These are applications (e.g., desktop clients, IDE integrations) that access data provided by the protocol.
- **MCP Clients:** They maintain one-to-one connections with servers, acting as intermediaries that handle requests and responses.
- **MCP Servers:** Lightweight programs that expose specific functionalities and access capabilities from local data sources or remote services.
- **Local Data Sources:** These include on-premises files, databases, and services that the servers securely access.
- **Remote Services:** External systems available via the internet (typically through APIs) that extend the functionalities available within the MCP ecosystem.

This modular architecture facilitates scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance, ensuring that each component can be developed, updated, and secured independently.
